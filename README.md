 # EMFF-2025_V1.0.pb: Energy Material Force Field - 2025, Version 1.0

## Overview

* EMFF-2025_V1.0.pb provides a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly toolset designed for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This force field is developed based on DeePMD-kit ([DeePMD-kit Documentation](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/master/index.html#)), supporting Windows and Linux platforms and is compatible with LAMMPS 2021 and later versions with DeepMD integration.

* For the installation and usage of DeepMD-enabled LAMMPS, please refer to the official guide: [LAMMPS-DeepMD Instructions](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/master/third-party/lammps-command.html).

* Thanks to GPU parallel computing architecture, EMFF-2025_V1.0.pb significantly accelerates LAMMPS execution, achieving nearly 30 times speedup. Related research results can be found in the following references:

## Usage & Applicability

In the examples directory, we provide LAMMPS standard input files (including in and data files) for RDX, HMX, and CL-20 thermal decomposition simulations. An example input file format is shown below:

* Lammps input file [RDX.in](https://github.com/MingjieWen/General-NNP-model-for-C-H-N-O-Energetic-Materials/blob/main/Examples/RDX/RDX.in)
* Data file [RDX.data](https://github.com/MingjieWen/General-NNP-model-for-C-H-N-O-Energetic-Materials/blob/main/Examples/RDX/RDX.data)

Please ensure that all parameter settings comply with LAMMPS and DeePMD-kit requirements.
## Notices
The original model EMFF-2025_V1.0.pb is suitable for MD simulations of systems with 1-5000 atoms. If you need to run simulations with a larger number of atoms, please use the compressed model.Model compression extracts the neural network structure and its parameters (weights, biases, etc.) from a trained model, significantly speeding up MD inference while maintaining minimal accuracy loss. Depending on the simulation system and training parameters, compression can achieve over 10√ó acceleration on both CPU and GPU devices. Additionally, model compression greatly reduces memory usage, lowering memory consumption by up to 20√ó under the same hardware conditions.When using model compression commands, be mindful of version compatibility. It is recommended to use the same version of the program, as lower-version frozen models require version conversion before compression.
For details on model compression methods, please refer to: [Model compress](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/master/freeze/compress.html)
